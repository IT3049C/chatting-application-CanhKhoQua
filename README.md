## Self-Reflection:
<!-- Write your self-reflection under this line -->
This assignment was quite fun however, it took much time to complete. There were some points that I had to research lots of page and couldn't find the correct solution even if I looked at the example code that shown in the guide. However, when I tried again and again and when the code worked. It was satisfied. This assignment gave me hands-on experience working with API fetching which I would like to learn more about it. And then when I finished the code and the tests weren't passed all. I spent much time figuring out and somehow when I tried adjusting timeout in playwright configuration file. My tests passed, and it was the happiest thing on that day.
### How long it took me to finish this?
I am not sure, maybe 7-8hours including testing it.

## Discussion Questions:
1. What does the bootstrap `display-4` class do?
This is the bootstrap attribute which will automatically tailor our heading but for the `-4`, this would make our heading smaller than `-1` or `-2`.
